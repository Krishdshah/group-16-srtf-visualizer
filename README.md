# SRTF Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer üìä

An interactive educational tool built with React to demonstrate the **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** CPU scheduling algorithm. This application provides a real-time, animated visualization of process execution, preemption, and the calculation of key performance metrics.

***

## Demo & Screenshots

This animation shows the SRTF algorithm in action, visualizing the preemption process as new jobs with shorter burst times arrive in the ready queue.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Dynamic Process Table**: Watch the status of each process‚Äîincluding its Remaining Burst Time, Completion Time, Turn Around Time, and Waiting Time‚Äîupdate in real-time.
-   **Animated Gantt Chart**: A Gantt chart is built dynamically, block by block, showing which process is using the CPU at any given moment.
-   **Step-by-Step Log**: A clear, descriptive log explains every decision the scheduler makes, such as process arrival, execution, preemption, and completion.
-   **Preemption Visualization**: The currently executing process is highlighted, and context switches due to preemption are clearly shown.
-   **Final Metrics Calculation**: Once all processes are complete, the application automatically calculates and displays the **Average Turn Around Time** and **Average Waiting Time**.
-   **Interactive Controls**: Simple "Start" and "Reset" buttons give you full control over the simulation.
